                                sweatshirts, but I also have a dyed pair of pants, a set of tank tops to wear under work
                                clothes, and a tie for special occasions.

                                In high school, I devoted most of my time to the robotics team. The team participated in
                                a competition called the <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc"
                                    target="_blank">FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)</a>. In this competition, a game
                                challenge is revealed, and then teams are given roughly 6 weeks to design, build, and
                                test a robot. Then, teams from around the world meet and use their robot to compete in a
                                series of 3 vs 3 matches. Our team consisted of roughly 100 members, of which about half
                                were dedicated to designing, fabricating, assembling, and programming the robot itself.
                                The team also had a dedicated business subteam for negotiating sponsorships, and a media
                                team for organizing outreach. Over my 4 years, I served several roles on the team.
                                I developed data collection and analytics tools to help predict the game
                                strategy of opponents, and eventually became the head strategist and captain of the
                                team. In addition to competition, the team does community outreach, to inspire children
                                to pursue a STEM education, and be excited about the future of technology.

                                My high school offered a class that promised to be an experience like no other. Instead
                                of standard quizzes, tests, and schoolwork, we would form into teams, come up with an
                                idea for a startup, and then work on gaining the skills needed to expand it. The year
                                culminated in the top teams giving a pitch in front of investors and the local
                                community, looking to gain support for the idea. My team’s idea was, in hindsight,
                                somewhat unoriginal. We wanted to create a competitor to the food delivery
                                giants, GrubHub and UberEats. To set ourselves apart, we planned to reduce our costs by
                                not actually hiring any drivers, but instead creating a marketplace of individuals to
                                sell their delivery services. The idea was that if somebody was planning on eating at a
                                restaurant, they could also order something on their way out and deliver it to the
                                customer. By using individuals who were already at a location, we could save some time
                                on delivery. Anything that is trying to “be the next Uber” or sells a “marketplace of
                                individuals” sets of red flags that the startup might be nothing more than a lazy, get
                                rich quick scheme, and our idea checked all the boxes.

                                Fortunately, good experiences can
                                come out of bad ideas; our team was the first to build our minimal viable product, or
                                prototype, by convincing some of the high school seniors with cars to bring back extra
                                food from restaurants for the underclassmen who had some spare change. We were also able
                                to partner with students from the software engineering class to demonstrate a payment
                                system where drivers could be efficiently compensated. At the end of the year, while we
                                were selected for the final pitch, we were not able to secure any funding, and the team
                                split apart to go to separate colleges. Ultimately, the experience is what pushed me to
                                seek out a business education, instead of a STEM field.

                                I spent a lot of my life thinking I would eventually study computer science. As a
                                result, my strongest skills that I can offer to a business team are my coding abilities.
                                I am familiar with the following technologies:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>HTML</li>
                                    <li>CSS</li>
                                    <li>Javascript</li>
                                    <li>React</li>
                                    <li>single-spa micro frontend</li>

                                In addition, I have experience with Scrum agile methodology, from the perspective of
                                both the development team, and as a product owner. I am hoping to be able to use these
                                skills to the benefit of my team in the First Year Integrated Core.
