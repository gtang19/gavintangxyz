        <p class="item-description">Healthcare is expensive… way more expensive than in other countries. That means that somewhere, there is some great inefficiency, right? Somewhere in the system there must be some sort of waste that could be corrected to bring down prices for everybody.</p>

          <h2>Specifications</h2>
          <p>Through research, we attempted to find any significant indicators of fraud, or large-scale inefficiency. For the most part, we found that the cost of developing new medical technology is just high, and inefficiency does not contribute significantly to the higher prices. However, when talking to patients, there is a perception that their money is being wasted.</p>
          <h2>Reviews</h2>
          <p>5.5/10 – healthcare being expensive is an issue. However, it is too broad of an issue, there are deeper, more specific roots that would be better to try to solve.</p>
          <h2>Key Insights</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Perception doesn't always match reality</li>
            <li>The perception of healthcare administration is really bad</li>
