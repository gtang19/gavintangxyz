        <p class="item-description">Normally when you buy something you consider its value to you, and if it’s worth spending the money on. In healthcare situations, it’s often more difficult to make this decision, because prices are high, and the services are often necessary to be healthy. This is especially true when you’re responsible for someone else’s health, such as a spouse, or a child.</p>

          <h2>Specifications</h2>
          <p>People we talked to felt that they had limited power in the healthcare process. For parents, the health of their child is not much of a choice, so they felt forced to agree to any treatment and accept the burden of any bill that shows up later.</p>
          <h2>Reviews</h2>
          <p>8/10 – we think this is getting closer to the root of the problem. The ability to choose what to purchase is a fundamental component of our economic system and understanding how healthcare plays the game differently is valuable.</p>
          <h2>Key Insights</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>People feel trapped by healthcare</li>
            <li>Healthcare doesn't behave the same way as other industries</li>
