        <p class="item-description">The healthcare pricing model is very ambiguous. You know you’re going to be paying something, probably, at some point, but you often don’t know exactly when, or how much. When the bill comes, it can be a surprise what you’re paying for.</p>
        <div class="item-buy">
          <h2>Specifications</h2>
          <p>We heard several stories where some hidden cost came out of nowhere. People value transparency in the billing process, and the current system obscures prices. Nobody likes hidden costs to begin with, but when combined with services that are necessary to stay healthy, people feel powerless in the system.</p>
          <h2>Reviews</h2>
          <p>9/10 – We think this is a large part of the overall problem. Frustrations regarding price in part due to how high costs are. Lowering costs would be fantastic, but not necessarily achievable without restructuring the entire healthcare model. Making the pricing more transparent is more obtainable.</p>
          <h2>Key Insights</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Price transparency is important</li>
            <li>People feel more secure when they know a price</li>
          </ul>
