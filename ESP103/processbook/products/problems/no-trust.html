        <p class="item-description">The billing process sucks. More importantly, everybody believes that it sucks. People have a perception that their money is going to some rich administrator’s pockets. They view healthcare administration is malicious, an entity that doesn’t view them as people, only as a number. This perception prevents patients from being able to trust the healthcare process.</p>

          <h2>Specifications</h2>
          <p>There are a wide variety of reasons people don’t trust the process. Clarity is a huge one – people don’t trust what they don’t understand. The ambiguity of billing statements makes it difficult to understand what is being asked of the patient, causing confusion and distrust. Additionally, people feel like prisoners of the system. They choose to treat their sick child, because why wouldn’t they? Then they’re hit by these confusing bills and see prices higher than they’d like, but they accept it because there was no other option.</p>
          <h2>Reviews</h2>
          <p>10/10 – this problem feels right. It ties together several core ideas from other problems and explains connections between otherwise unrelated ideas. The way patients perceive the hospital is arguably more important than the reality of what occurs. If we can pinpoint what fixable elements cause the distrust, we can significantly improve the healthcare administration experience.</p>
