          If people don’t trust healthcare right now, why don’t we just find someone that they do trust, and insert them into the process? If we create a mediator of some sort, someone who’s job is to advocate for a patient and be on their side for the whole process, then they might understand the process a little better.

          <h2>Specifications</h2>
          <p>Patients would have a personal helper of some sort throughout the process. Somebody they could express their concerns about the process to or ask clarifying questions. This person would add an element of human connection to the healthcare process, to help fight the feeling of dehumanization that occurs within the billing process.</p>
          <h2>Reviews</h2>
          <p>4/10 – this is an example of trying to force a solution. There are some parts of this solution that are nice, people like human connection. However, we already know that having too many parties involved frustrates patients, so adding more isn’t a great idea. Also, people don’t really want to talk to people if they don’t have to, they just want a process that works.</p>
          <h2>Key Insights</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Human connection is important</li>
            <li>The solution should just work</li>
