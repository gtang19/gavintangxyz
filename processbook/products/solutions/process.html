        <p class="item-description">The correct solution to the problem shouldn’t be obvious, but it should feel obvious once we figure it out. If it’s actually obvious, then it probably doesn’t work, but if it doesn’t feel obvious then it’s probably overcomplicated.</p>
        <div class="item-buy">
          <p>We knew there was a solution out there somewhere that fit these bizarre criteria, but we had no foothold or direction to move towards. In this situation, the only option is to come up with a high quantity of ideas and see what sticks.</p>
          <p>We had some really bad ideas. For example, people seem to trust doctors more than administration, so why don’t we have the doctors handle billing and administrators handle the surgery? As we learned more, we were able to make less assumptions, which allowed us to find better solutions.</p>
          <p>Some of our ideas were slightly better than administrators wielding scalpels.</p>
