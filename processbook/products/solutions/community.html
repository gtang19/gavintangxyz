          <h2>Specifications</h2>
          <p>The online community would include discussion, information, and just general support. There would likely need to be some kind of incentive to use the platform. Doctors and administrative staff could also answer questions and help clarify the process.</p>
          <h2>Reviews</h2>
          <p>4/10 – creating a tool to stand up against the billing process just complicates the process further. For the solution to really work, healthcare administration needs to pivot so that it isn’t the villain.</p>
          <h2>Key Insights</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>People need to be incentivized to use something new</li>
            <li>Healthcare administration can't be antagonized</li>
