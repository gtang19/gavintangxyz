        <p class="item-description">The healthcare process is confusing enough, even if you speak English fluently. It is especially confusing if you are less comfortable with the language.

          <h2>Specifications</h2>
          <p>Looking through the provided data, we determined that there may be a relationship between being Hispanic and opinions on the billing system. Starting with the broad assumption that some Hispanic people would be less familiar with English, we started talking to people about the language used in bills. What we found was that the language barrier is less between English and other languages, but instead between medical jargon and any language people can actually read.</p>
          <h2>Reviews</h2>
          <p>6.8/10 – this problem has potential. The language barrier for non-native English speakers is likely still a factor, we just didn’t seek out enough non-native English speakers to gain insight from.</p>
