        <p class="item-description">We recognized that we needed to find a problem in healthcare administration that has no obvious solution. If the solution were obvious, someone would have solved it already. Additionally, we knew we needed to get different perspectives; we’re young and haven’t really dealt with billing directly. </p>
        <div class="item-buy">
          <p>People who work in healthcare administration aren’t easy to contact, and they’re people that Cleveland Clinic already has access to. Any information that they have, Cleveland Clinic likely already knows. Instead of seeking out doctors or administrators, we wanted to focus on talking to adults, as almost all adults have had some experience with billing.</p>
          <p>We reached out to parents and professors to learn how people interact with healthcare administration, see their frustrations with the current system, and understand their point of view. Ultimately, it’s the patient’s perspective that matters the most to Cleveland Clinic, and we have the ability to gain that perspective in greater depth than could be achieved with a survey. We also tried to gain perspective by reading through the provided data and conducting research online.</p>
          <p>We came up with several possible problems to explore, and several of them tie in to what we believe is the root problem.</p>
