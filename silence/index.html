        The piece contains exactly four minutes and thirty-three seconds of rest. It is built on the idea that every
        sound can be silence. By not playing, anybody listening is able to hear ambient noise around them. 4’33”
        challenges conventional definitions of creativity. The piece is certainly unique, and breaks all musical norms,
        but at the same time, it doesn’t really “create” anything in the same sense that traditional artwork does. The
        absence of sound was always something that existed, John Cage just drew our attention to it by refusing to cover
        it with noise.

        Here is a distinctly creative musical performance that absolutely refuses to create. And because of that
        decision, everybody hears the performance in a different way. In the absence of noise, the background
        conversations, footsteps, and even one’s own breathing become the music.
        To me, creativity is ultimately about creating something, but creating something can never be the goal, or the
        driving force. In the same way that I cannot will a tree to grow faster, I cannot work harder to create
        something new. I can refine old patterns and create something better, something of value, but this will always
        be built, instead of created. Creation, to me, implies that there is something, where there was once nothing.
        Creativity to me is creating this environment where something can come from nothing.

        To be creative, I need to promote a silence where something new can be observed, and from there take that
        something new and see where it takes me. Somebody who is creative is someone who can very naturally observe a
        creative idea and attach themselves to it. The issue is that with this model, creativity appears to be entirely
        out of our hands, it is something that happens to us, and not something that we really control. That isn’t
        entirely true, but it’s how it feels to me right now. I would like to be able to better understand the process
        by which new ideas are created.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of right now though, I can create silence, and I can observe. I know I used to have creative capacity, and I
        don’t believe I’ve lost it, I just need to learn how to understand it in an increasingly complex world.
